Adult AHDH: Diagnosis (under construction)
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/Adult-ADHD/

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis, based on limited data in a single studies for each scale, suggests that the Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) Self-Report Index T-Score *is* the most accurate. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[substantial](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at 98% *across* scales, but cannot be measured for each scale as only a single study is available per scale. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below). Taylor previously concluded using different studies with different metrics, "Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating scale and the Wender Utah Rating Scale (short version) hadmore robust psychometric statistics and content validity" ([Taylor, 2011](#systematic-reviews)).
